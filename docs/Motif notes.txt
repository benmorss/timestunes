RULES FOR MOTIF MANIPULATION
The final note's duration can be modified.
It's likely ok to modify one note of a motif.  More notes = less likely.
One note = 80%.  Two notes = 25%.  Three notes = 10%.
More modification occurs as it goes along.
Certain modifications should be remembered - mutations that persist for x times through.

MOTIF MUTATIONS/MODIFICATIONS
Offset first note by an eighth beat, in either direction
 (maybe only if there is already an eighth note in the pattern)
 (ensure that we still enter strongly; that is, that we arrive on a strong beat soon)
 (and the result isn't something strange, like an eighth tied to a dotted quarter)

Offset one note by a pitch or two.
 (especially, take a leap and extend it)
 (it that results in a dissonance, that's usually ok if its gotten to by oblique/stepwise motion)

Shorten by a note or lengthen by a note.
 (Shorten is easier for us)
 (If lengthening, lengthen so that the extra note resolves a dissonance)

 It might be useful to have a few common formulas for development... for example, if the last two notes of a motif are stepwise, extend that by a step or two.  Or if they express a third, fill in the gap.  If they leap, try to go one step in the opposite direction.  Etc.


SUFFICIENT CONSONANCE
A more advanced idea would be to not allow total consonance all the time.
Consonant notes = notes that are a unison, third, fifth, or octave above the chord root... or... notes that are in the current chord.


FOR LATER VERSIONS OF TIMESTUNES
Eschew parallel fifths
Encourage contrary motion or at least one note being same
