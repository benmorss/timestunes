MAKING CHOICES BASED ON ARTICLE INFO

THINGS TO CHOOSE:
style, rhythm, tempo, accompaniment pattern, bass motif, main motif

SECTIONS

Sports
	Chord progressions: simpler
	Instrumentation: more martial instrumentation, rock
	Rhythm: rock, march

Arts
	any

Politics
	See sports :-)


TERMS

Obama
	Hail to the Chief

Energy

Beethoven
	5th Symphony motif


IMPLEMENTATION
There are so many weights that we may want to just pull them out of a db.
Each section needs weights for each chord progression, each instrumentation, each rhythm.  This might be like 300 weights.  Might be nice to store all that in a spreadsheet and import it via CSV or via an Excel-importing library.

Style: create a table full of weights:
			ROCK	FUNK
SPORTS		20		30
ARTS

To process this, it doesn't matter whether each row adds up to 100 - that can happen when the table gets put into the DB.
To make the actual choice, pull out of the db the weights for each style -- and then make a choice.

Main motif: for now, choose randomly.  These are stored in the db, like:
$model->choose_motif(Model::MAIN_MOTIF)

Bass motif: have one or two for each style.  Choose randomly.
$model->choose_motif(Model::BASS_MOTIF, $style)

Accomp. pattern: for now, one per style.
$model->choose_motif(Model:ACCOMPANIMENT, $style)

Tempo: for each section, have a set tempo.  Then it can get, say, 20% different in either direction, weighted toward the center.
$model->choose_tempo($style)

Optionally, those should be $weights->choose_motif(Weights:MAIN_MOTIF)

Then, the weights class would have something like:
function choose_tempo($style) {
	$base_tempo = $this->model->get_tempo($style);
	$multiplier = rand(0, rand(0, $this->MAX_TEMPO_SHIFT));
	return intval($base_tempo * $multiplier);
}

function choose_motif($choice, ???) {
	switch ($style) {
		case Model::MAIN_MOTIF:
			$style_weights = $this->model->getStyleWeightsForSection($section);
			// add them up
			// get a random number between 0 and the sum
			// pick your favorite!
		break;
	}
}
