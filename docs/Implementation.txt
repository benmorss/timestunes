IMPLEMENTATION

CLIENT-SIDE TASKS:
Retrieve section name and terms from metadata (some day it could pull much more)
Send those via AJAX to server side
The server will respond with quasi-MIDI data and names of soundfont files.
Parse that data and feed it to our player.
Make a player.
Find or create soundfonts for the patches we need to implement instrumentation palettes.

SERVER-SIDE CLASSES NEEDED:
MidiSequence - for converting between a MIDI sequence and our representation
NoteSequence - put Notes into it, get Notes out of it, get current index, etc
Motif - superclass of NoteSequence.
Score - putting music into a score, seeing what note is at a certain measure and beat, etc.
Weights - pull values by key out of an array, and also more complex weight determination.

PREMADE MUSICAL PATTERNS
Get a number (to be determined) of rhythmic patterns together.  (Steal from someone else!)
Get a number of instrumentation palettes together.

DATA
Quasi-MIDI data: what format should this have?  Perhaps we should just use standard MIDI.  Research that.


OTHER
Choose patches we'll need from insrumentation palettes.
