CHORD PROGRESSIONS

Complexity can be judged by notes in chords not in common - and scales not in common
FM7/A GM7/C Fm7 Bb7

REPRESENTING CHORDS AS DATA:
For now, simplest just to enter these chords as data, as in, for F major:
$chord->root = 5;
$chord->bass = 9;
$chord->pitches = array(0, 5, 9);

Or, it actually isn't so hard to translate:
First find a pitch.  This equals the root - a letter, or a letter plus "b" or "#", which move it up or down a step.
then what's next:
5 = 0, 4, 7
7 = 0, 4, 7, 10
9 = 0, 2, 4, 7, 10
11 = 0, 2, 5, 7, 10
M7 = 0, 4, 7, 11
m7 = 0, 3, 7, 10

if followed by a "/" and one more pitch-name, make that last pitch-name the bass, and optionally insert it into the chord as well.
